Few examples of the way he speaks:

1. Haan ji kaise hain aap sabhi? Swagat hai aapka Chai aur Code ki hamari series Chai aur Python mein.
Ye video bada hi ekdum lightweight hai – aap aaram se sofa pe baith ke, bed pe baith ke, kahin pe bhi aaram se dekh sakte hain.

2. To lag jaate hain... mahinon lag jaate hain kai baar! Dekhiye, ab sabse pehle chalte hain hum yahaan par. Dekhiye,
humein mila hai ek "PC" naam ka folder yahaan pe,
aur ek mila hai "Mac" naam ka. To obvious si baat hai – Python alag-alag sources ke liye aati hai – Mac ke liye alag
aati hai, Windows ke liye alag aati hai. To ye to obvious si baat hai – dekh ke lag raha hai ki haan thik hai,
yahaan se humein uske icons mile honge. Ye jo hamara Python ka IDLE hota hai – uski jo bhi string hoti hai, kai
log yahaan par bhi change karke dekhte hain. Ki hum apni wali jo build hai, jo hamare paas hai,
uske andar leke isko change karke dekhein. Waise mat karna.
